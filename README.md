BBOT is a powerful and modular OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) framework designed to map the attack surface of an organization. With BBOT, you can execute the entire OSINT workflow with just a single command.

BBOT is inspired by [Spiderfoot](https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot) but takes it to the next level with features like multi-target scans, lightning-fast asyncio performance, and NLP-powered subdomain mutations. It offers a wide range of functionality, including subdomain enumeration, port scanning, web screenshots, vulnerability scanning, and much more. BBOT has over 80 modules and counting.

Whether you're a pentester, security researcher, or bug bounty hunter, BBOT simplifies and automates the OSINT process so you can focus on the fun part: hacking!

# Getting Started

## Installation ([pip](https://pypi.org/project/bbot/))
Note: installing in a virtualenv (e.g. via `pipx`) is recommended. If you need help with installation, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bbot/wiki#installation).
~~~bash
# Prerequisites:
# - Linux (Windows and macOS are *not* supported)
# - Python 3.9 or newer

# stable version
pip install bbot

# bleeding edge (dev branch)
pip install --pre bbot

bbot --help
~~~

## Example Commands
Note: Scan output, logs, etc. are saved to `~/.bbot`.
~~~bash
# subdomains
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum

# subdomains (passive only)
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum -rf passive

# subdomains + port scan + web screenshots
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum -m naabu gowitness -n my_scan -o .

# subdomains + basic web scan (wappalyzer, robots.txt, iis shortnames, etc.)
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum web-basic

# subdomains + web spider (search for emails, etc.)
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum -c web_spider_distance=2 web_spider_depth=2

# everything at once because yes
# subdomains + emails + cloud + port scan + non-intrusive web + web screenshots + nuclei
bbot -t evilcorp.com -f subdomain-enum email-enum cloud-enum web-basic -m naabu gowitness nuclei --allow-deadly

# list modules
bbot -l
~~~

## Targets

Targets seed a scan with initial data. You can specify an unlimited number of targets, either directly on the command line or in files (or both!). Targets can be any of the following:

- DNS_NAME (`evilcorp.com`)
- IP_ADDRESS (`1.2.3.4`)
- IP_RANGE (`1.2.3.0/24`)
- URL (`https://www.evilcorp.com`)
- EMAIL_ADDRESS (`bob@evilcorp.com`)

For example, the following scan is totally valid:

~~~bash
# multiple targets
bbot -t evilcorp.com evilcorp.co.uk http://www.evilcorp.cn 1.2.3.0/24 other_targets.txt
~~~

## [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/blacklanternsecurity/bbot)
BBOT provides docker images, along with helper script `bbot-docker.sh` to persist your BBOT scan data.
~~~bash
# helper script
./bbot-docker.sh --help

# bleeding edge (dev)
docker run -it blacklanternsecurity/bbot --help

# stable
docker run -it blacklanternsecurity/bbot:stable --help
~~~
